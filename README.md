# Face-recognition-doorlock
My team and i designed a device that replaces ordinary door locks with a smart door lock that will open when it recognises the users face or someone that is trusted. There were 2 problems my team and i were trying to solve with our device.

The first is if you have an originally lock installed in your home and you lose your keys the only way you can enter your home is by finding a locksmith, which can be very expensive and time-consuming.

The second problem my team was trying to solve is if multiple people enter your home on a regular basis, you no longer need to worry about keeping track of who has the keys. And if you no longer want someone entering your home all you have to do is delete them from the system. Saving you the hassle of chasing after the keys. The first part of the device is a camera that is connected to a raspberry pie, it contains the facial recognition program. The second part of the device is the lock, that will be triggered if the facial recognition has verified the person at the door.
